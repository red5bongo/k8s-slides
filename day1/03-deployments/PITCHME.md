## Deployments

---

A deployment is a supervisor for pods and replica sets, giving you fine-grained
control over how and when a new pod version is rolled out as well as rolled back
to a previous state.

---

Let's create a [deployment](src/deployments/d09.yaml)
called `sise-deploy` that supervises two replicas of a pod as well as a replica set

+++?code=src/deployments/d09.yaml

+++

```bash
$ kubectl create -f src/deployments/d09.yaml
```

+++

You can see the deployment, the replica set and the pods it looks after like so

```bash
$ kubectl get deploy
NAME          DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
sise-deploy   2         2         2            2           10s

$ kubectl get rs
NAME                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
sise-deploy-3513442901   2         2         2         19s

$ kubectl get pods
NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
sise-deploy-3513442901-cndsx   1/1       Running   0          25s
sise-deploy-3513442901-sn74v   1/1       Running   0          25s
```

+++

At this point in time the `sise` containers running in the pods are configured
to return the version `0.9`. Let's verify that from within the cluster (using `kubectl describe`
first to get the IP of one of the pods)

+++

```bash
[cluster] $ curl 172.17.0.3:9876/info
{"host": "172.17.0.3:9876", "version": "0.9", "from": "172.17.0.1"}
```

+++

Let's now see what happens if we change that version to `1.0` in an updated
[deployment](src/deployments/d10.yaml):

+++?code=src/deployments/d10.yaml

+++

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f src/deployments/d10.yaml
deployment "sise-deploy" configured
```

+++

Note that you could have used `kubectl edit deploy/sise-deploy` alternatively to
achieve the same by manually editing the deployment.

+++

What we now see is the rollout of two new pods with the updated version `1.0` as well
as the two old pods with version `0.9` being terminated:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                           READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
sise-deploy-2958877261-nfv28   1/1       Running       0          25s
sise-deploy-2958877261-w024b   1/1       Running       0          25s
sise-deploy-3513442901-cndsx   1/1       Terminating   0          16m
sise-deploy-3513442901-sn74v   1/1       Terminating   0          16m
```

+++

Also, a new replica set has been created by the deployment:

```bash
$ kubectl get rs
NAME                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
sise-deploy-2958877261   2         2         2         4s
sise-deploy-3513442901   0         0         0         24m
```

+++

Note that during the deployment you can check the progress using `kubectl rollout status deploy/sise-deploy`.

+++

To verify that if the new `1.0` version is really available, we execute from
within the cluster (again using `kubectl describe` get the IP of one of the pods):

```bash
[cluster] $ curl 172.17.0.5:9876/info
{"host": "172.17.0.5:9876", "version": "1.0", "from": "172.17.0.1"}
```

+++

A history of all deployments is available via:

```bash
$ kubectl rollout history deploy/sise-deploy
deployments "sise-deploy"
REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE
1               <none>
2               <none>
```

+++

If there are problems in the deployment Kubernetes will automatically roll back to
the previous version, however you can also explicitly roll back to a specific revision,
as in our case to revision 1 (the original pod version):

+++

```bash
$ kubectl rollout undo deploy/sise-deploy --to-revision=1
deployment "sise-deploy" rolled back

$ kubectl rollout history deploy/sise-deploy
deployments "sise-deploy"
REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE
2               <none>
3               <none>

$ kubectl get pods
NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
sise-deploy-3513442901-ng8fz   1/1       Running   0          1m
sise-deploy-3513442901-s8q4s   1/1       Running   0          1m
```

+++

At this point in time we're back at where we started, with two new pods serving
again version `0.9`.

---

Finally, to clean up, we remove the deployment and with it the replica sets and
pods it supervises:

```bash
$ kubectl delete deploy sise-deploy
deployment "sise-deploy" deleted
```

for more options on deployments and when they are triggered.

### Exercises 

1. Redeploy `sise-deploy` deployment.
1. Navigate into the container and kill webserver process.
1. Observe whether kubernetes will try to redeploy container.
